Here you will see some simple projects I am working on. Most of them are written in Python as I am currently learning and working mainly with this language.



One of my first projects was the "Ping Pong" game. You can see a screenshot of it below:

Few minutes after finishing the code of my first game ("Ping Pong") I decided that it would be great if I can play the game all by myself without needing a partner. So I restructured it and created "Pong for one". The rules are simple, you should make sure that the ball won't fall under the paddle. You will have three lives and every time you miss, one of the lives will dissapear! Also the speed increases after every five points! You can see the game down below:
