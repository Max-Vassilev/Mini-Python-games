Here you will see some simple projects I am working on. Most of them are written in Python as I am currently learning and working mainly with this language. 



One of my first projects was the "Ping Pong" game. You can see a screenshot of it below:

Few minutes after finishing the code of my first game ("Ping Pong") I decided that it would be great if I can play the game all by myself without needing a partner. So I restructured it and created "Pong for one". The rules are simple, you should make sure that the ball won't fall under the paddle. You will have three lives and every time you miss, one of the lives will dissapear! Also the speed increases after every five points! You can see the game down below:

After three misses you lose the game. The "Game over" sign shows up and you get to see your best score.

I also recreated the famous "Snake" game. What a fun and challenging project! It includes a score counter and it also shows the "best result" of the previus attempts. Here is a screenshot of the game:

I also added a "Pause game" option to the game. When you press "p" the snake stops and the game is paused. Also the "Game paused" shows up.
